title: Forecasting the novel coronavirus COVID-19 Blog

	I recently read the publication, “Forecasting of the novel coronavirus COVID-19”, which is a scientific article, one of a collection of articles, taken from PLOS ONE. It presents multiple rounds that were done to estimate the number of cases that were emerging during a specified time period in South Korea, Iran, and Europe. 
  The big picture that was presented was that forecasting the spread of the virus decreased and the uncertainty of the spread increased over time. The forecast rounds and their time period are listed as the following: 
1st round - 01/02/2020 till 10/02/2020
2nd round - 11/02/2020 till 20/02/2020
3rd round - 21/02/2020 till 01/03/2020
4th round - 02/03/2020 till 11/03/2020
5th round - 12/03/2020 till 21/03/2020
  It was established that the forecast and uncertainty will continue to follow metric path and it was predicted that on March 17TH, 2020 the world would face an interval of 200k – 1mil cases. However, the publication did provide evidence to the ratio of recovery cases versus death, 14:1, and was supported by a recovery graph from COVID-19. The recovery percentage of all confirmed cases was at about 55%.
	So, though cases were emerging at an exponential rate, there was still a steadily increasing recovery cases rate. These are results and information the world needs to see, especially as fake news is at its prime during these dire times. I believe people need to go out of their way to do research on the current outbreak instead of relying solemnly on the media and sources that are not creditable. We need to take the time in gathering information and staying positive because I fear that if the forecast and uncertainty rates continue to proceed as they are now, we will be facing a much greater problem at hand.
